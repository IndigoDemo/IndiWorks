- [Rocket](https://github.com/rocket/rocket) and [jsRocket](https://github.com/rocket/rocket/tree/master/js)*

\* jsRocket is used for synchronizing with Rocket, but the code is also heavily inspired from this very library. Also the demo material is from this library. Go check out [Mogs' Github](https://github.com/mog) for more awesome stuff!
